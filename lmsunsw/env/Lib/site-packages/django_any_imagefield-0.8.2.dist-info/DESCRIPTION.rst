django-any-imagefield
=====================

This module offers a abstraction over the various image fields,
so allow third party applications can provide an imagefield at the authors choice.

Supported image fields:

* django-filebrowser-no-grappelli-django14_, which includes a preview and file selector.
* django-filebrowser-no-grappelli_, which is a different fork.
* SORL-thumbnail_, which includes a preview
* Django's default ``ImageField``, with a preview added to it.


Installation
============

First install the module, preferably in a virtual environment. It can be installed from PyPI::

    pip install django-any-imagefield

Or the current folder can be installed::

    pip install .

Configuration
-------------

Add the module to the installed apps::

    INSTALLED_APPS += (
        'any_imagefield',
    )

Usage
-----

In a Django model, the field can be included::

    from django.db import models
    from any_imagefield.models import AnyImageField

    class Article(models.Model):
        title = models.CharField("Title", max_length=200)
        image = AnyImageField("Image", upload_to='images')

        class Meta:
            verbose_name = "Article"
            verbose_name_plural = "Articles"

        def __unicode__(self):
            return self.title

By default, the ``AnyImageField`` displays a standard ``ImageField`` with a preview thumbnail.
When django-filebrowser-no-grappelli-django14_ or django-filebrowser-no-grappelli_ is installed, it will use the ``FileBrowseField`` from
that package to display the file/image browser. When your package has it's own ``ImageField`` variant/subclass,
please consider to add support for it in this package.
